2014 Course Syllabus

Purpose: To introduce basic and advanced engineering and neuroscience tools for analysis and simulation of motion and force production of vertebrate limbs. These are very broad fields at the interface of biology, physiology, medicine and engineering. Thus, the course emphasizes collaborative learning driven by carefully selected homework, readings, attendance of seminars, hands-on laboratory experiences, and in-class exams. This will enable students to complete a semester-long project related to a neuromuscular system of their choice using an engineering approach to the analysis and simulation.
